                Thanks to the 2018 Farm Bill, hemp was removed from Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act!  Yay! Does that mean you can grow as much of it as you want, 
                wherever you want? No, it does not. But in most states, it is now more or less legal to grow hemp. To be clear, hemp is defined as Cannabis containing less 
                than 0.3% total THC.  Marijuana is defined as Cannabis containing more than 0.3% total THC.

                What does total THC mean? It means the flower, which contains the bulk of all cannabinoids like CBD, THC, CBG and others, cannot contain more than 0.3% of all forms of THC,
                like delta-9-THC, the form that will get you high, but also THCA, the precursor to THC, which needs to be decarboxylated before it will produce any intoxicating effects.
                We’ll talk more about decarboxylation in the section on harvesting. This has been a particularly frustrating point for most commercial growers, cultivating their plants
                for CBD rich flowers, as current research suggests virtually all cultivars of CBD rich hemp will breach the 0.3% threshold once CBD reaches ~10%. For almost all CBD plants,
                this tends to be a few weeks before the flower is fully mature, meaning farmers must harvest their plants well before peak maturity in order to stay compliant. 
                There is a big push in the industry to get this changed to 1% total THC.  When and how the plants are tested differs by state, so you should be aware of these things
                 before you start.

                I will talk a little about fiber production later in the section on Growing, but this guide will focus on growing hemp for CBD.  If you’re just looking to grow a few plants in
                your backyard, you’ll first need to confirm that it’s legal to do so in your state, and also whether there are any local restrictions on growing it at home. You can check out
                this <a href="https://disa.com/map-of-marijuana-legality-by-state/">link</a> for more information from your state about whether you can grow hemp or marijuana at home. Most states will
                require you to be 21 years or older. If you can grow it at home, congratulations! What a fun and rewarding plant to grow! This guide will provide a wealth of information for
                commercial growers and home growers alike.

                to home growers in states where it’s legal  to do so. GIFH is an extension of Infinite Tree, a USDA Organic research farm and nursery I helped start back in 2017.
