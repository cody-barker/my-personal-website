                Thanks to the 2018 Farm Bill, hemp was removed from Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act!  Yay! Does that mean you can grow as much of it as you want, 
                wherever you want? No, it does not. But in most states, it is now more or less legal to grow hemp. To be clear, hemp is defined as Cannabis containing less 
                than 0.3% total THC.  Marijuana is defined as Cannabis containing more than 0.3% total THC.

                This guide will focus on growing hemp for CBD.  If you’re just looking to grow a few plants in
                your backyard, you’ll first need to confirm that it’s legal to do so in your state, and also whether there are any local restrictions on growing it at home. You can check out
                this <a href="https://disa.com/map-of-marijuana-legality-by-state/">link</a> for more information from your state about whether you can grow hemp or marijuana at home. Most states will
                require you to be 21 years or older. If you can grow it at home, congratulations! What a fun and rewarding plant to grow! This guide will provide a wealth of information for
                commercial growers and home growers alike.
