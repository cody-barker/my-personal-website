                    My name is Cody and I was the Director of Cultivation for Infinite Tree from 2017-2022. Infinite Tree is a USDA Organic hemp research farm and nursery, as well as an 
                    OLCC licensed Marijuana producer, located along the magical Applegate Valley of Southern Oregon. Infinite Tree specializes in breeding new cultivars for the
                    CBD smokeable flower market. Over the course of 5 years there, and with the help of my amazing small team, I helped build the farm from the ground up,
                    developing protocols and the infrastructure necessary to provide customers with high quality data and products. I have a wealth of experience with regards to cultivation,
                    and love to talk about all things related to growing, like irrigation, fertilization, Integrated Pest Management, breeding, harvesting, and so much more. Whether you're a home
                    grower looking for tips on how to grow hemp for the first time, or a seasoned commercial grower looking for ways to improve your practices, I hope this guide proves useful to you.
